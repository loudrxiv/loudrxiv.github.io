Please check out this link for their policy regarding this. Their general privacy policy can be found here.\nWe use Netlify Analytics to analyze the access logs stored by Netlify. This information is not shared with any third parties.\nSoftware We use Hugo to build our website. Hugo has additional privacy settings for GDPR compliance, and we configure it to be as privacy friendly as possible.\nServices like Disqus, Instagram, and Google Analytics are disabled. We do link to Twitter, Vimeo and Youtube in our blogs, and we turn on “enableDNT” and “privacyEnhanced” for those services.\nGit Repository We use GitHub to host our repository. In order to contribute to our website or to open a GitHub discussion, you will need a GitHub account.\nFor the Privacy policy of GitHub, please check out this link.\nMatrix We use Matrix as our primary communication method. Since Matrix is a Federated protocol, the privacy of our conversaion depends on that of your homeserver and the homeserver of your contact.\nYou should not have any expectation of privacy for your conversations in our public room, as anyone (be it a person or a bot) can access all of your messages and log them. Even if you “delete” your messages, it is merely a redaction request to the participating homeservers in the room, and any of them could choose to ignore said request.\nDirect or private messages with individuals are end to end encrypted by default. However, the Matrix protocol does not provide any metadata protection, and homeserver admins know who you have been talking to, how often you talk to them, and so on.\nEmail Our mail server is hosted by Tommy on his own Dedicated Server colocated in the United Kingdom. Many of us use our @privsec.dev email as an alias and forward it to another email provider. The privacy of your emails with us is the same as with any other person you communicate with using this protocol - the hosting providers can read all of your conversations with us unless you are using PGP, and even when you use PGP there is no metadata protection.\n","wordCount":"422","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-07-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-02-04T16:21:06-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"PrivSec.dev Team"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://privsec.dev/privacy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"PrivSec - A practical approach to Privacy and Security","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://privsec.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/theme.b20f95bb4da41ef90a2610a557a7000b2649a3f47282ec571676da6fc0427200.js integrity="sha256-sg+Vu02kHvkKJhClV6cACyZJo/RyguxXFnbab8BCcgA="></script><header class=header><div id=progressBar></div><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://privsec.dev accesskey=h title="PrivSec (Alt + H)"><img src=https://privsec.dev/privsec.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>PrivSec</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><input id=hamburger-input type=checkbox></input>
