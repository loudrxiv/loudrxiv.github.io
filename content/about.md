☢️ UNDER CONSTRUCTION

my name is mark. I wanted to make this website in order to communicate some more nuanced things about myself. I am in my late-20s and am currently in the midwest.

I have a series of interests and things I want to get into more:
- politics
- research
- dancing
- reading
- animation
- money
- video creation

As I am creating this, any posts I make are likely to fall within these categories --- especially research as I really do like doing it and am a current graduate student. anyways, if you have questions you can email me!

thanks.
