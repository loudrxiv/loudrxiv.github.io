This website is made by a fundamentally lazy individual (see header) to provide a brief overview on my public life!

The focus is on: interests, research, and hobbies. 

This template was taken from my appreciation of the larger [Privsec.dev](https://privsec.dev/) website; though I am working to diverge from its origin little-by-little

### MMMEA (or M.M.E., for short)
The guy who used HUGO and a git repo to make this site. I am currently a Graduate Student Research at the [Joint Carnegie Mellon-University of Pittsburgh Ph.D. Program](https://www.compbio.cmu.edu/) 

I still use my [undergraduate](https://umbc.edu/) email (lmao), what can I say, they give me free storage space :owo:
